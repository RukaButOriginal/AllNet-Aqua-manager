# AllNet-Aqua-manager
AllNet Aqua Server+Viewer manager UI written in batch

Download: https://github.com/RukaButOriginal/AllNet-Aqua-manager/releases
To run the UI, navigate to and launch *start.bat*






I mainly made this because it was a pain for me to figure out how to use both Aqua Viewer and Aqua Server
